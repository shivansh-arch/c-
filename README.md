# Daily C++ Practice Repository
This repository contains my daily C++ code practice as I learn and explore C++. Each folder or file represents a different day's exercises, challenges, or mini-projects.

Topics Covered
This repository includes examples of the following C++ concepts:

Basic Input/Output: Using cin and cout for user input and output.

Variables and Data Types: Declaration and use of int, float, and string.

Conditional Statements: if-else and the ternary operator for decision-making.

Loops: for and while loops for iteration.

Arrays: Both static and dynamic array allocation and manipulation.

Mathematical Operations: Basic arithmetic, as well as functions from the <cmath> library like pow.

Functions: Simple function definitions and calls.

Memory Management: Dynamic memory allocation with new and deallocation with delete[].

File Descriptions
Here is a brief overview of the C++ files in this repository:

age.c++: A simple program demonstrating the use of the ternary operator to check if an age is greater than 18.

arraymax.c++: Finds the maximum, second maximum, third maximum, and minimum values in an array.

classwork_09_oct.c++: A program that takes an array of integers from the user and prints out only the even numbers.

hcf.c++: Calculates the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

homework_09oct1.c++: Calculates the area of a circle given the radius.

homework_09oct2.c++: Calculates the perimeter of a rectangle.

homework_09oct3.c++: Calculates simple interest based on principal, rate, and time.

homework_09oct4.c++: Calculates compound interest.

homework_09oct5.c++: Converts temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

max.c++: A program with functions to find the maximum, minimum, and second largest of three numbers.

max2.c++: A simple program to find the maximum of three hardcoded integer values.

oct-08-25.c++: A "Hello, World!" program that also demonstrates iterating through a string.

static_vs_dynamic.txt: A text file explaining the difference between static and dynamic memory allocation in C++.

How to Use
To compile and run these C++ programs, you will need a C++ compiler (like g++).

Compiling
You can compile a .c++ file into an executable using the following command in your terminal:

Bash

g++ <filename>.c++ -o <output_filename>
For example, to compile age.c++, you would run:

Bash

g++ age.c++ -o age
Running
After compiling, you can run the executable file from your terminal:

Bash

./<output_filename>
For example:

Bash

./age
Future Plans
I will be updating this repository regularly with new C++ programs as I continue to learn and practice. Some of the topics I plan to cover in the near future include:

More complex data structures (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues).

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts (e.g., classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism).

File I/O operations.

Standard Template Library (STL) usage.
